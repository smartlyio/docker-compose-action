# Docker Compose Action

This action provides support for running docker compose with enforced cleanup after the job finished.

## Requirements

Requires `docker-compose` to be installed and available on the `PATH`.

## Environment variables

Uses the following github context environment variables to generate unique docker-compose project names:

- `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`
- `GITHUB_RUN_ID`
- `GITHUB_RUN_NUMBER`

## Inputs

| Name             | default                     | required | description                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| composeFile      | `docker-compose.yml`        | no       | The path to the docker-compose file(s) to use, relative to the workspace. In multiple docker-compose files case, add them as multiline yaml value using the `     | ` notation, one file per file. |
| serviceName      |                             | yes      | The name of the service to use defined in the compose file.                                                                                                       |
| composeCommand   | `up`                        | no       | One of `up` or `run` as the main compose command to execute.                                                                                                      |
| composeArguments | `--abort-on-container-exit` | no       | Option flags passed to the compose command.                                                                                                                       |
| runCommand       |                             | no       | Command to run in the container when composeCommand is 'run'; ignored otherwise.                                                                                  |
| build            | false                       | no       | Explicitly build the service image before running. Implies pull before build.                                                                                     |
| push             | on:push                     | no       | When to push the built image to the registry. 'on:push' means when the trigger event it a push to the branch. Otherwise true/false. Only runs if 'build' is true. |

## Outputs

| Name         | description                                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| container_id | The docker ID of the service container run. |

## Implementation

1. Run `docker-compose -p <project> pull <service>`
2. If `build` is `true`:
   - Run `docker-compose -p <project> build <service>`
3. Run the main command:
   - For `up` command, run `docker-compose -p <project> up <args> <service>`
   - For `run` command, run `docker-compose -p <project> run <args> <service> <run-command>`
4. As a post-build step, do cleanup:
   1. If `build` is `true` and `push` resolves to `true`:
      - Run `docker-compose -p <project> push <service>`
      - Ignore failures of this command to continue with cleanup
   2. Run `docker-compose -p <project> down --remove-orphans --volumes`
      - Ignore failures of this command to continue with cleanup
   3. Run `docker-compose -p <project> rm -f`
      - Ignore failures of this command to continue with cleanup
   4. If any errors were encountered during cleanup, fail the build.

## Example usage

```yaml
name: Test with compose

on:
  push:
    branches: [master]
  pull_request:
    branches: [master]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Test with docker-compose
        uses: smartlyio/docker-compose-action@v1
        with:
          composeFile: |
            docker-compose.yml
            docker-compose.ci.yml
          serviceName: test
          build: true
          push: 'on:push'
```

## Development

Install the dependencies

```bash
$ npm install
```

Build the typescript and package it for distribution

```bash
$ npm run build && npm run package
```

Run the tests :heavy_check_mark:

```bash
$ npm test

 PASS  ./compose.test.js
  âœ“ ...

...
```
